# Project
## Design, simulation & analysis of 4 bit adders using 45nm technology in cadence
The primary goal of this project is to compare the performance metricsâ€”specifically delay, power consumption, and silicon areaâ€”for both adder types. This comparative analysis highlights the inherent trade-offs in different adder designs when implemented in a modern nanoscale technology, offering insights for high-performance digital circuit applications.
###ðŸš€ Project Objectives
 * Design & Schematic Capture: Develop transistor-level schematics for 4-bit CLA and CSA adders, including optimized basic building blocks (full adders, logic gates) in 45nm technology.
 * Layout Design: Generate compact, DRC-clean, and LVS-verified physical layouts for both 4-bit adders, adhering to 45nm design rules.
 * Simulation & Analysis (Cadence Spectre/Spectre APS):
   * Measure propagation delay (worst-case, average-case).
   * Measure static and dynamic power consumption.
   * Determine the area footprint from layouts.
   * Conduct a detailed comparative analysis of delay, power, and area for CLA vs. CSA.
###ðŸ›  Methodology
 * Technology Setup: Configure Cadence Virtuoso with the 45nm CMOS Process Design Kit (PDK).
 * Basic Cell Design: Design and characterize fundamental logic gates and a 1-bit full adder.
 * Carry Look-Ahead (CLA) Adder: Implement the carry generation (Gi) and propagation (Pi) logic, then integrate it with full adders to form the 4-bit CLA.
 * Carry-Select (CSA) Adder: Design the parallel computation blocks (assuming Cin=0 and Cin=1) and multiplexer-based selection logic for the 4-bit CSA.
 * Schematic Verification: Perform functional simulations to ensure correct behavior.
 * Layout Implementation: Create optimized physical layouts considering transistor sizing, routing, and power distribution.
 * Post-Layout Simulation: Extract parasitics from layouts and run simulations for accurate performance measurements.
 * Data Analysis: Compile simulation results and conduct a comprehensive comparative study.
